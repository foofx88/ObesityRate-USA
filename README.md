<h3>Obesity Rate in USA - Project Obesity Ver. 2.0</h3>
<hr>

<p>A Re-do of 1st Project - <a href= "https://github.com/foofx88/Project_Obesity">Project Obesity</a> with Microsoft's Power BI visualisation and further analysis on the data.</p>
<p>I have decided to give the dataset a second run due to the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Limited capabilities and visualisations being the 1st project from the course</li>
  <li>Previously a group effort, I want to showcase what I can do with the dataset on my own</li>
  <li>Perform full ETL on the dataset and visualize them with Power BI</li> 
  <li>Add interactive elements for user to easily understand and make sense of the dataset through more visualisations</li> 
  <li>Potential in the dataset to be further explored</li>
</ul>
